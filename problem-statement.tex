        	This document is written using one sentence per line.
        	This allows you to have sensible diffs when you use \LaTeX with version control, as well as giving a quick visual test to see if sentences are too short/long.
        	If you have questions, ``The Not So Short Guide to LaTeX'' is a great resource (\url{https://tobi.oetiker.ch/lshort/lshort.pdf})

\section{Goals}

    Primary goal is to demonstrate a practical implementation of searchable encryption

        Command-line interface is fine; we don't need a flashy ui, although that's a good stretch goal

            Also nice to have: mobile app

        Primary purpose is as a research project (proof of concept) rather than a polished product

        Attila and Thang have done published a research paper and done a preliminary implementation of a particular searchable encryption algorithm

        Need to figure out optimal datastructure for actually using it? Says there are 10s of options publshed â€“ need to get familiar with those

        Connect it to a cloud service like Amazon

        Will lean heavily on research by David Cash



    Onec that's working, want to hook it up to a database of emails

        Attila doesn't think this will be very difficult to set up once the first \^ project is done. I'm skeptical. Need to find out more details about what he has in mind.



    A third, noncritical, project is to implement a password manager using ORAM (oblivious RAM) algorithms

        This is very much a stretch goal which we would only work on after completing the first two projects. It's fine if we don't get to it at all.

\section{Motivation}

        Want to build tools that help protect privacy and fight mass surveillance

        No open-source implementation of searchable encryption

        There's one that Cash did(?) but it's tied up in IP rights at IBM(?) and isn't available

\section{Metrics}

        Correctness

        Reasonable performance

            Searchable encryption: on order of milliseconds

            Searchable email: TBD

            Password manager: ~100ms
